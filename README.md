# Project: "I'M SORRY, GOD'S CALLING ME"


## Concept Overview

“I'M SORRY, GOD'S CALLING ME” explores the tension between earthly distractions and spiritual calling. This project encapsulates the struggle of maintaining focus amidst the noise of everyday life. The imagery portrays a man and a woman at a crossroads, symbolizing the choices we face when divine messages beckon us, yet worldly distractions pull us away.

### Themes:

- **Isolation and Connection**: The settings illustrate a sense of isolation in the search for connection, whether in a vast field or a crowded train station.
- **Divine Communication**: The vintage phone signifies a call from God, suggesting that clarity can emerge amidst confusion.
